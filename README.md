"""
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 using your browser. We have 3 routes. First of them (index)
just redirects to login page. So overall, we have a total of 2 pages. Login page 
and Protected page. Login page has a form containing login and password fields where
an user is able to enter his or her data. If authorization process went successfully, 
route will return corresponding token, otherwise, it will show an error indicating that 
user with given data does not exists.
